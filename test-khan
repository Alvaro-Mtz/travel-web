        <h2>The origin of the name</h2>
        
        <p>
            In the period 1624–1925 the name of the fjord was Kristianiafjorden (or Christianiafjorden), since Christiania was the name of the capital in this period. The old Norse name of the fjord was Fold, giving names to the counties of Vestfold ('the district west of Fold') and Østfold ('the district east of Fold') and also the district Follo.

           · <em id= "munchMus">Munch Museum</em> is situated at Tøyen in the <a href= "#oslo"><strong>Oslo</strong></a> borough of Gamle <a href= "#oslo"><strong>Oslo</strong></a>. Construction of the museum was financed from the profits generated by the <a href= "#oslo"><strong>Oslo</strong></a> municipal cinemas and opened its doors in 1963 to commemorate what would have been <em id= "munchMus">Munch's</em> 100th birthday. Its collection consists of works and articles by <em id= "munchMus">Munch</em>, which he donated to the municipality of <a href= "#oslo"><strong>Oslo</strong></a> upon his death, and additional works donated by his sister Inger <em id= "munchMus">Munch</em>, as well as various other works obtained through trades of including duplicate prints.
The museum now has in its permanent collection well over half of the artist's entire production of paintings and at least one copy of all his prints. This amounts to over 1,200 paintings, 18,000 prints, six sculptures, as well as 500 plates, 2,240 books, and various other items. The museum also contains educational and conservation sections, and has facilities for the performing arts.
The museum structure was designed by architects Einar Myklebust and Gunnar Fougner. Myklebust also played an important role in the expansion and renovation of the museum in 1994 for the 50th anniversary of <em id= "munchMus">Munch's</em> death. This site has also been the location of filming for an Olsenbanden-movie from 1984.
